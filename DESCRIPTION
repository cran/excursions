Description: Functions that compute probabilistic excursion sets, contour
    credibility regions, contour avoiding regions, and simultaneous confidence
    bands for latent Gaussian random processes and fields. The package also
    contains functions that calculate these quantities for models estimated
    with the INLA package. The main references for excursions are Bolin and
    Lindgren (2015) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12055>, Bolin and Lindgren (2017)
    <doi:10.1080/10618600.2016.1228537>, and Bolin and Lindgren (2018)
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v086.i05>. These can be generated by the citation
    function in R.
